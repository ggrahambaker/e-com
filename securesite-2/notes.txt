ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

day 1

ETHERNET
-network method

OLD VERSION
-sends packets of bits back and forth to communicate
	-detects for collisions between different messages 
-minimum content size is to make sure that the wire can detect collisions

CURRENT VERSION
-star topology
	-computers now just look to network for information. 
-repeater
	-this network would forwards all packets to all attached computers
	-faster, as soon as the first bit in the packet comes in, the network passes it on
-switcher
	-this passes specific packets to specific receivers 
	-this allows multiple people to send packets to multiple receivers at the same time
	-slower, must wait to see the whole packet to pass it along
	-full duplex, allows a to send to b, and c to send to a at the same time

PROTOCOLS
-in order to talk to someone, you need to know their MAC address. 
	-MAC address, a unique signature for each computer
-the switch needs to know the MAC address of each one of the attached ports
	-if a switch does not recognize the MAC address, it will turn into a repeater and send it everywhere in the hope that it finds the MAC address


IP, Internet Protocol
	-address: 164.143.1.1
	-Net Mask: 255.255.255.0
		-indicates if the IP address is local or not
		-if the ip address line up with the 
-properties
	-best effort delivery ()
		-packet loss
		-data corruption
		-out of outer delivery
	-connectionless (stateless)


ROUTERS vs SWITCHES
-routers make decisions based on IP address
-if IP address is local, operates as a switch, if its not local, it will send the packet to the Default Gateway, that will take care of it.

things to ask about: net mask

day 2

IP v4 - ip address with 4 billion possibilities (2^32)
IP v6 - new ip address system


if the node decides that the IP address is not local, than it will forward it to the IP address of the router

a gateway is the same thing as a router. the gateway offers a connection from the local network to the rest of the world



IP -properties
	-best effort delivery ()
		-packet loss
		-data corruption
		-out of outer delivery
	-connectionless (stateless)

TCP Properties
-reliable
-ordered
-connections
	-connected to a piece of soft ware running on hardware
	-Ports
		- 192.168.1.1:80, the 80 indicates a particular port, or the location of where the program is running


Application level
DHPC - assigns the computer that goes on the internet an IP address
DNS - the thing that switches the text on the browser, to an IP address
FTP, SFTP - file transfer stuff

IMAP - email
SSL (secure socket layer) - all the data on the wire is encrypted

What does this have to do with E commerce

DNS - find server
HTTP - serve web pages
SSH & SSL - secure data


Public vs Private IP addresses
-4 billion addresses
-Private IP addresses give us more IP addresses 
Private IP address rules
1. a public IP can never send to a private one
2. a private IP have to 


Client / Server model 
ftp, web brewers, ssh on the client side all hook up with compartmentalized servers


anatomy of a web address

INTRO TO SERVERS

PuTTY
FileZilla
Linux command shells



HOME WORK

I am a database.pugetsound.edu guy


things that you need to make a website

-domain name 
	- registrar
-Server
	- hosting companies
	- why would you want a host company?
		-maintenance
		-if there is lots of traffic, they will fix it
		-how to choose
			- price, uptime, services
		- ICDSoft a good hosting company

Intro to HTML

~username means the root directory for the username


What do hackers do??
-Earn Fame
-Vandalism
-personal data
-extortion
-botnets
-denial of service
-social engineering
	-social agenda to get into 


Attack Vectors
-sneaker net
	- virus built into drive
	- defense
		- disable autorun
-booby-trapped emails
	- defense
		- don’t open attachments
-tainted links
	- defense
		- be careful where you click
-drive-by downloads
	- defense
		- secure browser



Why is it so hard to secure a browser?
- 
What does a browser do?
	-reads the text file and interprets it to get all the necessary resources
What else do browsers do?
	-download stuff/upload
		-so they have to communicate with your hard drive



Secure
	- a computer is secure if you can depend on it and its software to behave as you expect
	- secure a web server and the data that is on it
	- securing information that travels between the server and the user
	- securing the end user’s machine


Securing the server
	- physical access
	- access control
	- only “safe” programs
	- redundancy
	- sufficient capacity
	- multiple connections
	- securing DNS

 



Network Terms

-HOST
	-computer connected to a network
-NETWORK
	-collection of locally connected computers
	-what is a locally connected network
		-net mask
			- indicates if IP is local or not
-GATEWAY
	-connections between networks

-FIREWALL
	-packet filter
		-filter on many different types of criteria
			-ip address, port number, ect. 


THE INTERNET

i need a connection with an internet service company to get on the internet, so you have to payyy. 



Naming Servers
	- network solutions
	- ICANN
		- stability: first priority
		- competition
			- enhances user choice and satisfaction
		- private sector, bottom-up coordination
			- better for companies to take care of it because its more efficient than the government
		- representation
				
	
Cryptography

plain text -> encrypt -> cipher text
	   <- decrypt <-

Encryption vs Obfuscation
- encryption is more
	- mathematical
	- harder
	- secure

Which thing is unknown?
	-encryption
		- e(plainText, k) -> cipherText
		- k is unknown
	- obfuscation
		- o(plainText) -> obfuseText
		- o is unknown

How to pick a good key?
	-“Random” number
		- cryptographically secure random numbers
- the Random class in java is just a list of random numbers, so its not truly random because there will be a pattern at 
	 

html formszz.
get vs post

- get
	- data is part of URL
	- data can be part of bookmark
	- data is visible
		- this is nice if the data is not private
- post
	- data is part of request
	- no size limit



Cryptography
authentication
	- i am who i claim to be
authorization
	- i authorize the following action
confidentiality
	- private communication
integrity
	- nobody tampered with this


Cryptography cant…

- protect unencrypted data
- protect against stolen keys
- protect against DoS
- protect against Traffic Analysis
	- meta data
		- who sent what to who
		- it doesn’t really matter who is saying what
- protect against a traitor or mistake
- protect against an open system


Digital Copyright Millennial Act
- makes it illegal to pass information about how to break into 




Who are you?

Identification, Authentication, Authorization? 

Why is this an issue?
	- loss of neighborhood
	- trust
		- cash purchases
	- enforcement

Computer based
	- password
	- biometrics
	- security devices
	- location

Identity based on…
	- What you know
	- What you have
	- Unique aspects of you
